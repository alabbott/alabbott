### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alan! I'm a Technology Consultant and general nerd. Learn more about me on my [website](https://alanabbott.me).

I'm currently working on learning rust and brushing up on old skills. I have primarily written in php before but I'm excited to be trying something new with rust.

I wouldn't expect to see anything wonderful here, but I'm hoping to write some cool things and learn more about software!
