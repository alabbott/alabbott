### Hi there 👋

My name is Alan! I'm a Technology Consultant and general nerd. Learn more about me on my [website](https://alanabbott.me).

I'm currently working on learning rust and brushing up on old skills. I have primarily written in php before but I'm excited to be trying something new with rust. I'd like to write a few web server / REST API applications in rust, enough to feel proficient. I'd also like to learn a front-end framework for building websites. I used to write html / css but that seems to be a thing of the past, at least without a significant amount of JS.

Professionally, I focus on SCADA / manufacturing systems. I specifically work with data analytics software and industrial IoT software within the manufacturing industry. I'm excited to see the manufacturing space start to align more with more modern norms.

I wouldn't expect to see anything wonderful here, but I'm hoping to write some cool things and learn more about software!
